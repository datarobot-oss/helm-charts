### Prerequisites

Before installing the Operator make sure you follow this guide and complete all
steps from it, otherwise the Operator won't function properly: https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator/blob/master/docs/installation/installation.md#tyk-operator-installation

**_NOTE_:** cert-manager is required as described [here](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-stack/tyk-operator/installing-tyk-operator/#step-2-installing-cert-manager).
If you haven't installed `cert-manager` yet, you can install it as follows:
```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.8.0/cert-manager.yaml
```
